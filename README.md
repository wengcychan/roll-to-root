# 🌱 Roll to Root

"Roll to Root" is a game inspired by French Petanque, introducing unique gameplay dynamics. Players strategically aim to roll their balls as close as possible to the reference point, the "root". The game adds complexity with the introduction of parent and children balls, allowing players to outmaneuver opponents.
